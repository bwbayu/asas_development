"Briefly, how does selection sort work?","It selects the minimum from an array and places it on the first position, then it selects the minimum from the rest of the array and places it on the second position, and so forth.","Selection sort is usually a recursive sorting method where you divide the elements to be sorted in half repeatedly. You then sort the smallest case, then work your way up, sorting each until they are all sorted.",2.5,0.5,sag,sag-81
"Briefly, how does selection sort work?","It selects the minimum from an array and places it on the first position, then it selects the minimum from the rest of the array and places it on the second position, and so forth.","selection sort is when you pick a data member and put it in a new array, then you pick another data member and put it in order with the new array, then pick another and insert it in the correct place in the new array, etc etc",3.0,0.6,sag,sag-81
"Briefly, how does selection sort work?","It selects the minimum from an array and places it on the first position, then it selects the minimum from the rest of the array and places it on the second position, and so forth.","Selection sort iterates through the array one element at a time, seeking the least value from the right and replacing the current value with it.",4.5,0.9,sag,sag-81
What is the advantage of linked lists over arrays?,"Linked lists are dynamic structures, which allow for a variable number of elements to be stored.","Linked lists are not confined to a specific size, and can have elements added and removed far easier. They are also easier to traverse.",5.0,1.0,sag,sag-82

What is the advantage of linked lists over arrays?,"Linked lists are dynamic structures, which allow for a variable number of elements to be stored.",Linked lists may be dynamically grown.,5.0,1.0,sag,sag-82
What is a queue?,A data structure that stores elements following the first in first out principle. The main operations in a queue are enqueue and dequeue.,A queue is a data type that operates under a FILOFirst In Last Outmethod. This means that the first element inserted into the queue is the first element removed.,4.0,0.8,sag,sag-83
What is a queue?,A data structure that stores elements following the first in first out principle. The main operations in a queue are enqueue and dequeue.,"a queue is a list of data that follows the fifo principle, an example of this would be when you get into a line at a movie theater ... the first one there gets to buy a ticket first",5.0,1.0,sag,sag-83
What is a queue?,A data structure that stores elements following the first in first out principle. The main operations in a queue are enqueue and dequeue.,A queue is a data structure where the first node in is the first node out.,5.0,1.0,sag,sag-83
What is the Euler tour traversal of a tree?,"A walk around the tree, starting with the root, where each node is seen three times: from the left, from below, from the right.","You travel the outside edge of the tree, clockwise, while naming each node.",4.0,0.8,sag,sag-84
What is the Euler tour traversal of a tree?,"A walk around the tree, starting with the root, where each node is seen three times: from the left, from below, from the right.","the euler tour is a way to traverse a tree where you come into contact with each node three times, from the left, from the right, and from the bottom",5.0,1.0,sag,sag-84

How do you delete a node from a binary search tree?,"Find the node, then replace it with the leftmost node from its right subtreeor the rightmost node from its left subtree.",You remove the element from the tree and move the next highest element from the left into its place.,4.5,0.9,sag,sag-85
How do you delete a node from a binary search tree?,"Find the node, then replace it with the leftmost node from its right subtreeor the rightmost node from its left subtree.","to delete the node, you would have to link the children nodes that are connected to the node to be deleted to the remaining nodes of the tree in such a way that nodes on the right of the parent node are larger than the parent and nodes on the left of the parent node are smaller",4.0,0.8,sag,sag-85
How do you delete a node from a binary search tree?,"Find the node, then replace it with the leftmost node from its right subtreeor the rightmost node from its left subtree.","If the node is a leaf, just set it is parent 's pointer to null and delete it, if it has a single child, set the parent 's pointer to the child and delete; if it has two children, set the node to one of the middle children and remove that child from its previous position as a leafrightmost child of the left subtree or leftmost child of the right subtree.",5.0,1.0,sag,sag-85
