"Which implementation -LRB- array-based vs. list-based -RRB- is preferred, and why?",link based because they are dynamicno size constraints,usually linked list because it does not have a fixed size but if you know or want to set a max size array is better,5.0,sag,sag-82,82
"Which implementation -LRB- array-based vs. list-based -RRB- is preferred, and why?",link based because they are dynamicno size constraints,list based because of the lower processing overhead and nearly unlimited space due to linked list design,5.0,sag,sag-82,82
"Which implementation -LRB- array-based vs. list-based -RRB- is preferred, and why?",link based because they are dynamicno size constraints,linked lists are preferred for implementing stacks because they are not limited to a set number of elements,5.0,sag,sag-82,82
"Which implementation -LRB- array-based vs. list-based -RRB- is preferred, and why?",link based because they are dynamicno size constraints,the list based implementation is preferred since the big o1is very efficient,3.0,sag,sag-82,82
"Which implementation -LRB- array-based vs. list-based -RRB- is preferred, and why?",link based because they are dynamicno size constraints,list because it its size is not determined,5.0,sag,sag-82,82
"Which implementation -LRB- array-based vs. list-based -RRB- is preferred, and why?",link based because they are dynamicno size constraints,linked list because it takes up less memory and is scalable,3.0,sag,sag-82,82
"Which implementation -LRB- array-based vs. list-based -RRB- is preferred, and why?",link based because they are dynamicno size constraints,list based allows more flexablity with size of the stack,5.0,sag,sag-82,82
"Which implementation -LRB- array-based vs. list-based -RRB- is preferred, and why?",link based because they are dynamicno size constraints,list based because the nodes are easier to work with and can be traversed easier,3.0,sag,sag-82,82
"Which implementation -LRB- array-based vs. list-based -RRB- is preferred, and why?",link based because they are dynamicno size constraints,list based implementation is much easier to implement and allows the stack to scale as necessary it is therefore the preferred implementation,5.0,sag,sag-82,82
"Which implementation -LRB- array-based vs. list-based -RRB- is preferred, and why?",link based because they are dynamicno size constraints,array based list is preferred because it can hold any size as long as u specify it,1.0,sag,sag-82,82
"Which implementation -LRB- array-based vs. list-based -RRB- is preferred, and why?",link based because they are dynamicno size constraints,list based because arrays can become full lists can grow or shrink as needed,5.0,sag,sag-82,82
"Which implementation -LRB- array-based vs. list-based -RRB- is preferred, and why?",link based because they are dynamicno size constraints,list bases implentation is preferred one of the main reasons is because of that the list has no fixed size,5.0,sag,sag-82,82
"Which implementation -LRB- array-based vs. list-based -RRB- is preferred, and why?",link based because they are dynamicno size constraints,link list is preferred because it makes pushing elements easier because there is no limit other than memory to the number of elements,5.0,sag,sag-82,82
"Which implementation -LRB- array-based vs. list-based -RRB- is preferred, and why?",link based because they are dynamicno size constraints,array is preferred linked list implementation requires extra space to store pointers space is allocated dynamically in the list based which takes more time,2.5,sag,sag-82,82
"Which implementation -LRB- array-based vs. list-based -RRB- is preferred, and why?",link based because they are dynamicno size constraints,array based implementation requires less memory than a list based inceasing the size of a resizeable array can waste storage and time,3.5,sag,sag-82,82
"Which implementation -LRB- array-based vs. list-based -RRB- is preferred, and why?",link based because they are dynamicno size constraints,a list based implementation is preferred because the list is more flexible than a array,5.0,sag,sag-82,82
"Which implementation -LRB- array-based vs. list-based -RRB- is preferred, and why?",link based because they are dynamicno size constraints,list based it can grow and shrink dynamically unlike the fixed size array,5.0,sag,sag-82,82
