How do you delete a node from a binary search tree?,"Find the node, then replace it with the leftmost node from its right subtreeor the rightmost node from its left subtree.","if the node is a leaf it can simply be deallocated or deleted from memory, and its parent 's reference to it changed to NULL. If the node has a single child, the pointer to it should be made to point to its child before deleting the node. Should the node have two children, the easiest solution may be to copy the node 's entire subtree to a new array or tree, delete the node and all descendants, then add the elements taken from the subtree back into the main tree.",4.5,0.9,sag,sag-85
