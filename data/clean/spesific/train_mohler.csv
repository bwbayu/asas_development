How do you delete a node from a binary search tree?,find the node then replace it with the leftmost node from its right subtreeor the rightmost node from its left subtree,you must first traverse the tree to find the appropriate value then you must make sure that the node is a leaf node if it is then you can delete the pointer to that specific node,3.0,sag,sag-14
How do you delete a node from a binary search tree?,find the node then replace it with the leftmost node from its right subtreeor the rightmost node from its left subtree,if root set root to null else if deleting right leaf set rightptr of parent node to null else if deleting left leaf set leftptr of parent node to null else if deleting a left or right subtree child node set the max leaf child in the left subtree as the new child node,4.5,sag,sag-14
